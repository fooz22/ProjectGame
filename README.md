 4. Business Logic
 
   The database was built using MySQL and linked with the php file using the XAMPP
   server. The database consists of three columns containing the user name, email and
   password
   PHP is a server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language that may be used to
   create dynamic Web pages. It is available for most operating systems and Web
   servers, and can access most common databases, including MySQL. PHP may be
   run as a separate program or compiled as a module for use with a Web server.
   The PHP application needs to communicate with a database server and for this
   communication process we need to write PHP code to perform such activities as
   connecting to the database server, querying the database, and other database
   related functions. Software is required to provide the API that your PHP application
   will use and handle the communication between your application and the database
   server.
   With PHP, we connected to work with the databases. MySQL is the most popular
   database system used with PHP. The data in a MySQL database are stored in tables.
   A table is a collection of related data, and it consists of columns and rows. MySQL
   provides connectors for a variety of languages, including PHP. There are several
  PHP APIs for accessing the MySQL database. For this game we chose MySQL.
